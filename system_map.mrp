  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:1073 - This design has 1161 KEEP_HIERARCHY constraints specified
   and therefore, may take a very long time to process. If your design has
   unexpectedly long run times, please consider minimizing the number of
   KEEP_HIERARCHY constraints in your design or use the -ignore_keep_hierarchy
   command line switch to have them ignored by MAP.

WARNING:Pack:1653 - At least one timing constraint is impossible to meet because
   component delays alone exceed the constraint. A timing constraint summary
   below shows the failing constraints (preceded with an Asterisk (*)). Please
   use the Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line) with the Mapped NCD and
   PCF files to identify which constraints and paths are failing because of the
   component delays alone. If the failing path(s) is mapped to Xilinx components
   as expected, consider relaxing the constraint. If it is not mapped to
   components as expected, re-evaluate your HDL and how synthesis is optimizing
   the path. To allow the tools to bypass this error, set the environment
   variable XIL_TIMING_ALLOW_IMPOSSIBLE to 1.


   For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
   Analyzer Reference manual; for more information on TRCE, consult the Xilinx

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  54 block(s) removed
   8 block(s) optimized away
 117 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
